# Credit-Card-Detection-System

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project aims to build an effective machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions from genuine ones.
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and customers alike, and traditional rule-based systems may not always be sufficient to detect sophisticated fraudulent activities. 
In this project, advanced machine learning techniques are employed to enhance fraud detection accuracy and reduce financial losses.
